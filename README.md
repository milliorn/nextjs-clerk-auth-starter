# Simple Next.js & React Authentication With Clerk

This is a simple example of how to use [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) to add authentication to a Next.js app.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

It will prompt you a series of questions.

```
√ What is your project named? ... clerk-starter
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... No / Yes
```

I selected TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, `src/` directory, App Router, and the default import alias.

Name your project whatever you want, then `cd` into the directory and run:

```bash
clerk-starter
```
